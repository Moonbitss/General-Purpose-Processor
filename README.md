# General Purpose Processor

## Description
This project is a simple multi purpose processor made in Quartus II to be used on a FPGA board.  

## Features
- Arithemetic functions on 7-Segment Display
- Bitwise Operations on 8-bit inputs
- Displays the current output on 7-Segment Displays

### Dependencies
The project uses Quartus II and a functioning FPGA board.

### Running the Application
To run the program, execute the ASU files on the Quartus II Software upon connecting to a FPGA board.
